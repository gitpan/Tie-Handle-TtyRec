NAME
    Tie::Handle::TtyRec - write a ttyrec

VERSION
    Version 0.02 released 13 Dec 07

SYNOPSIS
        use Tie::Handle::TtyRec;
        my $handle = Tie::Handle::TtyRec->new("foo.ttyrec");
        print $handle "hello", "world";

DESCRIPTION
    A ttyrec is a format used for recording terminal sessions. Notably,
    practically all NetHack games are recorded using ttyrecs. ttyrecs
    include precise timing data and can be a little fiddly. This module lets
    you focus on your application, instead of making sure your ttyrec
    headers are perfect.

    The usual way to use this module is through its "new" interface. It will
    clobber the file you decide to record to. A way of allowing you to
    instead append will be included in a future version.

    Each argument to print will be put into its own ttyrec frame, using the
    current time. So, the following will create three separate frames,

        print $handle "foo", "bar", "baz";

    The following will create only one frame,

        print $handle "foo" . "bar" . "baz";
